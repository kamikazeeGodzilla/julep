## Introduction

Julep is a platform for creating AI agents that remember past interactions and can perform complex tasks. It offers long-term memory and manages multi-step processes.

Julep enables the creation of multi-step tasks incorporating decision-making, loops, parallel processing, and integration with numerous external tools and APIs.

While many AI applications are limited to simple, linear chains of prompts and API calls with minimal branching, Julep is built to handle more complex scenarios which:

- have multiple steps,
- make decisions based on model outputs,
- spawn parallel branches,
- use lots of tools, and
- run for a long time.

> [!TIP]
> Imagine you want to build an AI agent that can do more than just answer simple questions—it needs to handle complex tasks, remember past interactions, and maybe even use other tools or APIs. That's where Julep comes in. Read [Understanding Tasks](#understanding-tasks) to learn more.

## Key Features

1. 🧠 **Persistent AI Agents**: Remember context and information over long-term interactions.
2. 💾 **Stateful Sessions**: Keep track of past interactions for personalized responses.
3. 🔄 **Multi-Step Tasks**: Build complex, multi-step processes with loops and decision-making.
4. ⏳ **Task Management**: Handle long-running tasks that can run indefinitely.
5. 🛠️ **Built-in Tools**: Use built-in tools and external APIs in your tasks.
6. 🔧 **Self-Healing**: Julep will automatically retry failed steps, resend messages, and generally keep your tasks running smoothly.
7. 📚 **RAG**: Use Julep's document store to build a system for retrieving and using your own data.

![features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4355cbae-fcbd-4510-ac0d-f8f77b73af70)

> [!TIP]
> Julep is ideal for applications that require AI use cases beyond simple prompt-response models.

## Quick Example

Imagine a Research AI agent that can do the following:

1. **Take a topic**,
2. **Come up with 100 search queries** for that topic,
3. Perform those web **searches in parallel**,
4. **Summarize** the results,
5. Send the **summary to Discord**.

> [!NOTE]
> In Julep, this would be a single task under <b>80 lines of code</b> and run <b>fully managed</b> all on its own. All of the steps are executed on Julep's own servers and you don't need to lift a finger.

Here's a working example:

```yaml
name: Research Agent

# Optional: Define the input schema for the task
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    topic:
      type: string
      description: The main topic to research

# Define the tools that the agent can use
tools:
  - name: web_search
    type: integration
    integration:
      provider: brave
      setup:
        api_key: BSAqES7dj9d... # dummy key

  - name: discord_webhook
    type: api_call
    api_call:
      url: https://eobuxj02se0n.m.pipedream.net # dummy requestbin
      method: POST
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

# Special variables:
# - inputs: for accessing the input to the task
# - outputs: for accessing the output of previous steps
# - _: for accessing the output of the previous step

# Define the main workflow
main:
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: >-
          You are a research assistant.
          Generate 100 diverse search queries related to the topic:
          {{inputs[0].topic}}

          Write one query per line.
    unwrap: true

  # Evaluate the search queries using a simple python expression
  - evaluate:
      search_queries: "_.split('\n')"

  # Run the web search in parallel for each query
  - over: "_.search_queries"
    map:
      tool: web_search
      arguments:
        query: "_"
    parallelism: 10

  # Collect the results from the web search
  - evaluate:
      results: "'\n'.join([item.result for item in _])"

  # Summarize the results
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: >
          You are a research summarizer. Create a comprehensive summary of the following research results on the topic {{inputs[0].topic}}.
          The summary should be well-structured, informative, and highlight key findings and insights:
          {{_.results}}
    unwrap: true
    settings:
      model: gpt-4o-mini

  # Send the summary to Discord
  - tool: discord_webhook
    arguments:
      content: |-
        f'''
        **Research Summary for {inputs[0].topic}**

        {_}
        '''
```

In this example, Julep will automatically manage parallel executions, retry failed steps, resend API requests, and keep the tasks running reliably until completion.

    name="Storytelling Agent",
    model="claude-3.5-sonnet",
    about="You are a creative storyteller that crafts engaging stories on a myriad of topics.",
)

### Step 2: Create a Task that generates a story and comic strip

task_yaml = """
name: Storyteller
description: Create a story based on an idea.

tools:
  - name: research_wikipedia
    integration:
      provider: wikipedia

main:
  # Step 1: Generate plot idea
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: You are {{agent.name}}. {{agent.about}}
      - role: user
        content: >
          Based on the idea '{{_.idea}}', generate a list of 5 plot ideas. Go crazy and be as creative as possible. Return your output as a list of long strings inside ```yaml tags at the end of your response.
    unwrap: true

  - evaluate:
      plot_ideas: load_yaml(_.split('```yaml')[1].split('```')[0].strip())

  # Step 2: Extract research fields from the plot ideas
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: You are {{agent.name}}. {{agent.about}}
      - role: user
        content: >
          Here are some plot ideas for a story:
          {% for idea in _.plot_ideas %}
          - {{idea}}
          {% endfor %}

          To develop the story, we need to research for the plot ideas.
          What should we research? Write down wikipedia search queries for the plot ideas you think are interesting.
          Return your output as a yaml list inside ```yaml tags at the end of your response.
    unwrap: true
    settings:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      temperature: 0.7

          query: _

  - evaluate:
      wikipedia_results: 'NEWLINE.join([f"- {doc.metadata.title}: {doc.metadata.summary}" for item in _ for doc in item.documents])'

  # Step 4: Think and deliberate
  - prompt:

          {% endfor %}

          Here are the results from researching the plot ideas on Wikipedia:
          {{_.wikipedia_results}}

          Think about the plot ideas critically. Combine the plot ideas with the results from Wikipedia to create a detailed plot for a story.
          Write down all your notes and thoughts.
          Then finally write the plot as a yaml object inside ```yaml tags at the end of your response. The yaml object should have the following structure:

          ```yaml
          title: "<string>"
          characters:

              role: "<string>"
            plotlines:
            - "<string>"```

          Make sure the yaml is valid and the characters and scenes are not empty. Also take care of semicolons and other gotchas of writing yaml.
    unwrap: true

  - evaluate:
      plot: "load_yaml(_.split('```yaml')[1].split('```')[0].strip())"
"""

task = client.tasks.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    **yaml.safe_load(task_yaml)
)

### Step 3: Execute the Task

execution = client.executions.create(
    task_id=task.id,
    input={"idea": "A cat who learns to fly"}
)

# 🎉 Watch as the story and comic panels are generated
while (result := client.executions.get(execution.id)).status not in ['succeeded', 'failed']:
    print(result.status, result.output)
    time.sleep(1)

# 📦 Once the execution is finished, retrieve the results
if result.status == "succeeded":
    print(result.output)
else:
    raise Exception(result.error)

## Components

Julep is made up of the following components:

- **Julep Platform**: The Julep platform is a cloud service that runs your workflows. It includes a language for describing workflows, a server for running those workflows, and an SDK for interacting with the platform.
- **Julep SDKs**: Julep SDKs are a set of libraries for building workflows. There are SDKs for Python and JavaScript, with more on the way.
- **Julep API**: The Julep API is a RESTful API that you can use to interact with the Julep platform.

### Mental Model

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38420b5d-9342-4c8d-bae9-b47c28ae45af" height="360" />
</div>

Think of Julep as a platform that combines both client-side and server-side components to help you build advanced AI agents. Here's how to visualize it:

1. **Your Application Code:**

   - You can use the Julep SDK in your application to define agents, tasks, and workflows.
   - The SDK provides functions and classes that make it easy to set up and manage these components.

2. **Julep Backend Service:**

   - The SDK communicates with the Julep backend over the network.
   - The backend handles execution of tasks, maintains session state, stores documents, and orchestrates workflows.

3. **Integration with Tools and APIs:**
   - Within your workflows, you can integrate external tools and services.
   - The backend facilitates these integrations, so your agents can, for example, perform web searches, access databases, or call third-party APIs.

## Concepts

Julep is built on several key technical components that work together to create powerful AI workflows:

    classDef core fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class Agent,Tasks,Session core;
```

- **Agents**: AI-powered entities backed by large language models (LLMs) that execute tasks and interact with users.
- **Users**: Entities that interact with agents through sessions.
- **Sessions**: Stateful interactions between agents and users, maintaining context across multiple exchanges.
- **Tasks**: Multi-step, programmatic workflows that agents can execute, including various types of steps like prompts, tool calls, and conditional logic.
- **Tools**: Integrations that extend an agent's capabilities, including user-defined functions, system tools, or third-party API integrations.
- **Documents**: Text or data objects associated with agents or users, vectorized and stored for semantic search and retrieval.
- **Executions**: Instances of tasks that have been initiated with specific inputs, with their own lifecycle and state machine.

## Understanding Tasks

Tasks are the core of Julep's workflow system. They allow you to define complex, multi-step AI workflows that your agents can execute. Here's a brief overview of task components:

- **Name, Description and Input Schema**: Each task has a unique name and description for easy identification. An input schema (optional) that is used to validate the input to the task.
- **Main Steps**: The core of a task, defining the sequence of actions to be performed. Each step can be a prompt, tool call, evaluate, wait_for_input, log, get, set, foreach, map_reduce, if-else, switch, sleep, or return. (See [Types of Workflow Steps](#types-of-workflow-steps) for more details)
- **Tools**: Optional integrations that extend the capabilities of your agent during task execution.

### Lifecycle of a Task

You create a task using the Julep SDK and specify the main steps that the agent will execute. When you execute a task, the following lifecycle happens:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Your Code
    participant C as Julep Client
    participant S as Julep Server

    D->>C: Create Task
    C->>S: Submit Execution
    Note over S: Execute Task
    Note over S: Manage State
    S-->>C: Execution Events
    C-->>D: Progress Updates
    S->>C: Execution Completion
    C->>D: Final Result
```

### Types of Workflow Steps

Tasks in Julep can include various types of steps, allowing you to create complex and powerful workflows. Here's an overview of the available step types:

#### Common Steps

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>About</th>
    <th>Syntax</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>Prompt</b> </td>
<td>
Send a message to the AI model and receive a response
<br><br><b>Note:</b> The prompt step uses Jinja templates and you can access context variables in them.
</td>

<td>

```yaml
- prompt: "Analyze the following data: {{agent.name}}" # <-- this is a jinja template
```

```yaml
- prompt:
    - role: system

    - role: user
      content: "Analyze the following data: {{_.data}}"
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>Tool Call</b> </td>
<td>
Execute an integrated tool or API that you have previously declared in the task.
<br><br><b>Note:</b> The tool call step uses Python expressions inside the arguments.

    </a>
</div>

## Tool Types

Agents can be given access to a number of "tools" -- any programmatic interface that a foundation model can "call" with a set of inputs to achieve a goal. For example, it might use a `web_search(query)` tool to search the Internet for some information.

Unlike agent frameworks, julep is a _backend_ that manages agent execution. Clients can interact with agents using our SDKs. julep takes care of executing tasks and running integrations.

Tools in julep can be one of:

1. **User-defined `functions`**: These are function signatures that you can give the model to choose from, similar to how [openai]'s function-calling works. They need to be handled by the client. The workflow will pause until the client calls the function and gives the results back to julep.
2. **`system` tools**: Built-in tools that can be used to call the julep APIs themselves, like triggering a task execution, appending to a metadata field, etc.
3. **`integrations`**: Built-in third party tools that can be used to extend the capabilities of your agents.
4. **`api_calls`**: Direct api calls during workflow executions as tool calls.

### User-defined `functions`

These are function signatures that you can give the model to choose from, similar to how [openai]'s function-calling works. An example:

```yaml
name: Example system tool task
description: List agents using system call

tools:
  - name: send_notification
    description: Send a notification to the user
    type: function
    function:
      parameters:
        type: object
        properties:
          text:
            type: string
            description: Content of the notification

main:
  - tool: send_notification
    arguments:
      content: '"hi"' # <-- python expression
```

Whenever julep encounters a _user-defined function_, it pauses, giving control back to the client and waits for the client to run the function call and give the results back to julep.

> [!TIP] > **Example cookbook**: [cookbooks/13-Error_Handling_and_Recovery.py](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/dev/cookbooks/13-Error_Handling_and_Recovery.py)

### `system` tools

Built-in tools that can be used to call the julep APIs themselves, like triggering a task execution, appending to a metadata field, etc.

`system` tools are built into the backend. They get executed automatically when needed. They do _not_ require any action from the client-side.

For example,

```yaml
name: Example system tool task
description: List agents using system call

tools:
  - name: list_agent_docs
    description: List all docs for the given agent
    type: system
    system:
      resource: agent
      subresource: doc
      operation: list

main:
  - tool: list_agents
    arguments:
      limit: 10 # <-- python expression
```

#### Available `system` resources and operations

- `agent`:

  - `list`: List all agents.
  - `get`: Get a single agent by id.
  - `create`: Create a new agent.
  - `update`: Update an existing agent.

- `change_status`: Change the status of a resource (specific resources not specified in the provided code).
- `chat`: Chat with a resource (specific resources not specified in the provided code).
- `history`: Get the chat history with a resource (specific resources not specified in the provided code).
- `create_or_update`: Create a new resource or update an existing one (specific resources not specified in the provided code).

Note: The availability of these operations may vary depending on the specific resource and implementation details.

> [!TIP] > **Example cookbook**: [cookbooks/10-Document_Management_and_Search.py](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/dev/cookbooks/10-Document_Management_and_Search.py)

### Built-in `integrations`

Julep comes with a number of built-in integrations (as described in the section below). `integration` tools are directly executed on the julep backend. Any additional parameters needed by them at runtime can be set in the agent/session/user's `metadata` fields.

See [Integrations](#integrations) for details on the available integrations.

> [!TIP] > **Example cookbook**: [cookbooks/01-Website_Crawler_using_Spider.ipynb](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/dev/cookbooks/01-Website_Crawler_using_Spider.ipynb)

### Direct `api_calls`

julep can also directly make api calls during workflow executions as tool calls. Same as `integration`s, additional runtime parameters are loaded from `metadata` fields.

For example,

```yaml
name: Example api_call task
tools:
  - type: api_call
    name: hello
    api_call:
      method: GET
      url: https://httpbin.org/get

main:
  - tool: hello
    arguments:
      json:
        test: _.input # <-- python expression
```

## What's the difference between Julep and LangChain etc?

### Different Use Cases

Think of LangChain and Julep as tools with different focuses within the AI development stack.

LangChain is great for creating sequences of prompts and managing interactions with LLMs. It has a large ecosystem with lots of pre-built integrations, which makes it convenient if you want to get something up and running quickly. LangChain fits well with simple use cases that involve a linear chain of prompts and API calls.

Julep, on the other hand, is more about building persistent AI agents that can maintain context over long-term interactions. It shines when you need complex workflows that involve multi-step tasks, conditional logic, and integration with various tools or APIs directly within the agent's process. It's designed from the ground up to manage persistent sessions and complex workflows.

Use Julep if you imagine building a complex AI assistant that needs to:

- Keep track of user interactions over days or weeks.
- Perform scheduled tasks, like sending daily summaries or monitoring data sources.
- Make decisions based on prior interactions or stored data.
- Interact with multiple external services as part of its workflow.

Then Julep provides the infrastructure to support all that without you having to build it from scratch.

### Different Form Factor

Julep is a **platform** that includes a language for describing workflows, a server for running those workflows, and an SDK for interacting with the platform. In order to build something with Julep, you write a description of the workflow in `YAML`, and then run the workflow in the cloud.

Julep is built for heavy-lifting, multi-step, and long-running workflows and there's no limit to how complex the workflow can be.

LangChain is a **library** that includes a few tools and a framework for building linear chains of prompts and tools. In order to build something with LangChain, you typically write Python code that configures and runs the model chains you want to use.

LangChain might be sufficient and quicker to implement for simple use cases that involve a linear chain of prompts and API calls.

### In Summary

Use LangChain when you need to manage LLM interactions and prompt sequences in a stateless or short-term context.

Choose Julep when you need a robust framework for stateful agents with advanced workflow capabilities, persistent sessions, and complex task orchestration.
